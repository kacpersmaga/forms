# Forms Project

## Overview

This project is a user-friendly **Sign-Up Form** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The form provides a responsive design with built-in validation, offering a smooth and interactive user experience. The main goal of this project was to practice and improve skills in creating, styling, and handling forms in web development.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adjusts well to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Form Validation**:
  - Required fields include first name, email, phone number, password, and password confirmation.
  - Real-time validation feedback for invalid inputs (e.g., email format, password confirmation).
- **Password Confirmation**: Ensures the user correctly types their password twice before submission.
- **Styled Input Fields**: Inputs include focus and error styling for better user experience.
- **User Prompt**: Includes a call-to-action and a prompt for users who already have an account.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the form.
- **CSS**: Styles the form and input fields, including focus and error effects.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and form handling (e.g., validation checks).

## What I Learned

This project focused on improving my understanding of **HTML form elements** and best practices for handling forms in web development. Key takeaways include:

- Using **input types** (`text`, `email`, `password`, etc.) effectively for different data needs.
- Implementing **HTML attributes** like `required`, `minlength`, and `maxlength` for basic validation.
- Creating **responsive layouts** using CSS Flexbox for form cells and overall structure.
- Enhancing user experience with **real-time feedback** using input focus and error states.
